This challenge is very similar to the last, except the variable changeme has to be "0x496c5962"
To do this simply send in a cyclical pattern and discover which group gives you control over the value.
In this case it was "aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffffgggghhhhiiiijjjjkkkkllllmmmmnnnnooooppppqqqq".
The q's give you control over the changeme value.
This means putting the bytes will net the proper code flow.
To do this use pwntools with "p32(0x62596c49, endian='big')".
This will net "b'bYlI'".
Then the final string is simply "aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffffgggghhhhiiiijjjjkkkkllllmmmmnnnnooooppppbYlI"
That's it.
