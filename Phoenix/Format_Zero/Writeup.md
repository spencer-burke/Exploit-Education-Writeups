# Challenge Theory
This is a simple format string vulnerability where the attacker has to modify the "changeme" variable to not be anything but 0.
# Challenge Source Code
```
#include <err.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define BANNER \
    "Welcome to " LEVELNAME ", brought to you by https://exploit.education"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    struct {
        char dest[32];
        volatile int changeme;
    } locals;
    char buffer[16];

    printf("%s\n", BANNER);

    if (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer) - 1, stdin) == NULL) {
        errx(1, "Unable to get buffer");
    }
    buffer[15] = 0;

    locals.changeme = 0;

    sprintf(locals.dest, buffer);

    if (locals.changeme != 0x45764f6c) {
        printf("Uh oh, 'changeme' is not the magic value, it is 0x%08x\n", locals.changeme);
    } else {
        puts("Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed correctly!");
    }

    exit(0);
}
```
# Solution
Therer are multiple valid solutions.
One solution would be
```
%i%i%i%i%i
```
Another solution which makes more sense would be
```
%32xAAAA
```
In this solution, 32 bytes on the stack get converted to hexadecimal values, then the actual changeme variable gets set to "AAAA".
This works because the actual changeme variable is 32 bytes away on the stack.
