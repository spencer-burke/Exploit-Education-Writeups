# Challenge Theory
For this challenge it is a simple buffer overflow with a 128 bit buffer. This means a few things. First, the shellcode can only be 136 bytes long(still a lot of space). With this in mind it is time to find the offset.
# Identifying the Vulnerability
To identify this vulnerability sending character strings larger than 128 bits will result in something. Using A's, or the pwn.cyclic will work.
